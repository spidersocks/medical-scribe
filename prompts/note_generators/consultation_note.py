**"GOLD STANDARD" CONSULTATION NOTE EXAMPLE 1: CARDIOLOGY**
```json
{
  "Consultation Request": "Cardiology consultation requested by Dr. Johnson for evaluation of new onset atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation management.",
  "History of Present Illness": "Thank you for consulting me on this pleasant 72-year-old male with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation. The patient was admitted 2 days ago with pneumonia and was noted to be in atrial fibrillation on telemetry. He reports palpitations that started approximately 3 days ago, associated with mild dyspnea. He denies chest pain, syncope, or presyncope. He has never had palpitations before. Of note, he was hypoxic on admission and has been improving with antibiotics and oxygen therapy.",
  "Past Medical History": [{"text": "Hypertension"}, {"text": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus"}, {"text": "Chronic kidney disease stage 3"}, {"text": "Community-acquired pneumonia (current admission)"}],
  "Past Surgical History": [{"text": "Cholecystectomy 10 years ago"}],
  "Family History": [{"text": "Father with CAD"}, {"text": "Mother with stroke"}],
  "Social History": [{"text": "Non-smoker"}, {"text": "Denies alcohol or drug use"}],
  "Current Medications": [{"text": "Lisinopril 10mg daily"}, {"text": "Metformin 1000mg twice daily"}, {"text": "Ceftriaxone 1g IV daily (for pneumonia)"}, {"text": "Azithromycin 500mg daily (for pneumonia)"}],
  "Allergies": [{"text": "No known drug allergies"}],
  "Pertinent Physical Examination": {
    "Vital Signs": "BP 138/82, HR 110-130 (irregularly irregular), RR 18, Temp 98.6°F, O2 Sat 94% on 2L NC",
    "General": "Alert, oriented, no acute distress",
    "Cardiovascular": "Irregularly irregular rhythm. No murmurs. JVP normal. No peripheral edema",
    "Respiratory": "Scattered rhonchi in right lower lobe, improved from admission. No wheezing"
  },
  "Diagnostic Studies Reviewed": [
    {"text": "EKG: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, rate 120. No acute ST-T changes"},
    {"text": "Chest X-ray: Right lower lobe consolidation, improving"},
    {"text": "Labs: Troponin negative x2. TSH 2.1 (normal). BNP 450. Creatinine 1.4 (baseline). Potassium 4.2. Magnesium 2.0"},
    {"text": "Echocardiogram (from 6 months ago): EF 55%, normal valves, mild LVH"}
  ],
  "Assessment": "72-year-old male with new onset atrial fibrillation, likely precipitated by acute pneumonia and systemic illness. He is currently hemodynamically stable with controlled ventricular response on current medications. CHA2DS2-VASc score is 4 (age, hypertension, diabetes, prior stroke in mother), indicating significant stroke risk. HAS-BLED score is 2 (age, hypertension), indicating moderate bleeding risk but anticoagulation still favored.",
  "Recommendations": [
    {"text": "Rate Control: Start metoprolol 25mg PO BID. Target heart rate <110 at rest. Can uptitrate as tolerated"},
    {"text": "Anticoagulation: Recommend starting apixaban 5mg PO BID for stroke prevention given CHA2DS2-VASc score of 4. Patient counseled on bleeding risks vs. stroke risk; agrees to anticoagulation"},
    {"text": "Rhythm: Given this is likely secondary to acute illness, would observe for now. If remains in AFib after pneumonia resolves, consider outpatient cardioversion or chronic AFib management"},
    {"text": "Follow-up: Will follow throughout hospitalization. Recommend cardiology follow-up 2-4 weeks post-discharge for reassessment and possible long-term rhythm management strategy"},
    {"text": "Labs: Recheck basic metabolic panel in 3 days after starting metoprolol to assess renal function"},
    {"text": "Patient and primary team may contact me with any questions or concerns"}

**"GOLD STANDARD" CONSULTATION NOTE EXAMPLE 2: NEPHROLOGY**
```json
{
  "Consultation Request": "Nephrology consultation requested by Dr. Smith for acute kidney injury and hyperkalemia management.",
  "History of Present Illness": "Thank you for asking me to see this 58-year-old female with acute kidney injury. The patient was admitted yesterday with dehydration and nausea. Her baseline creatinine is 1.0, and today it is 3.2. She reports decreased urine output over the past 2 days and has had significant vomiting. She takes lisinopril and ibuprofen regularly. She denies any recent IV contrast exposure, new medications, or rashes. No recent illnesses or fevers.",
  "Past Medical History": [{"text": "Hypertension"}, {"text": "Osteoarthritis"}],
  "Current Medications": [{"text": "Lisinopril 20mg daily (held on admission)"}, {"text": "Ibuprofen 800mg TID PRN pain"}],

  "Pertinent Physical Examination": {
    "Vital Signs": "BP 108/65, HR 88, RR 16, Temp 98.4°F",
    "General": "Alert, appears mildly dehydrated",
    "Cardiovascular": "Regular rate and rhythm. No JVD. No edema",
    "Abdomen": "Soft, non-tender",
    "Volume Status": "Mucous membranes dry. Skin turgor decreased. Flat neck veins. No peripheral edema"
  },
  "Diagnostic Studies Reviewed": [
    {"text": "Creatinine trend: Baseline 1.0 → 2.1 (yesterday) → 3.2 (today)"},
    {"text": "BUN: 68 (BUN/Cr ratio >20 suggesting prerenal)"},
    {"text": "Potassium: 5.8"},
    {"text": "Urinalysis: Specific gravity 1.030, no blood, no protein, rare hyaline casts. FeNa <1%"},
    {"text": "Renal ultrasound: Normal sized kidneys bilaterally. No hydronephrosis. No stones"}
  ],
  "Assessment": "58-year-old female with acute kidney injury, most consistent with prerenal azotemia secondary to volume depletion from vomiting and poor oral intake, compounded by NSAID use and ACE inhibitor. FeNa <1% supports prerenal etiology. Mild hyperkalemia likely secondary to AKI and ACE inhibitor use.",
  "Recommendations": [
    {"text": "Volume Repletion: Aggressive IV hydration with normal saline at 150cc/hr. Reassess volume status and renal function in 12-24 hours"},
    {"text": "Medication Management: Continue holding lisinopril. Discontinue ibuprofen - recommend acetaminophen for pain instead. Avoid nephrotoxins"},
    {"text": "Hyperkalemia: Potassium 5.8 is mild. Dietary potassium restriction. Recheck potassium in AM. If continues to rise or develops EKG changes, will treat more aggressively"},
    {"text": "Monitoring: Daily BMP. Strict I&Os. Daily weights. Foley catheter not needed at this time as patient is making urine"},
    {"text": "Prognosis: Expect renal function to improve with hydration given prerenal picture. If creatinine does not improve or continues to rise despite adequate hydration, will need to reconsider diagnosis and possibly pursue renal biopsy"},
    {"text": "Long-term: Once recovered, patient should avoid NSAIDs. Can cautiously restart lisinopril at lower dose as outpatient once creatinine back to baseline. Counseled patient on kidney-friendly practices"}

SPECIFIC_INSTRUCTIONS = """
**SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONSULTATION NOTES:**
- **Consultation Request**: State clearly who requested the consult and why (the specific question to be answered)
- **History of Present Illness**: Focused on the consultation question. Start with a brief "Thank you for consulting me on..." statement
- **Past Medical History**: Include relevant history, not necessarily comprehensive
- **Pertinent Physical Examination**: Focused exam relevant to the consultation question, not comprehensive head-to-toe
- **Diagnostic Studies Reviewed**: List all relevant labs, imaging, studies reviewed with key findings
- **Assessment**: Your consultant interpretation and clinical reasoning
- **Recommendations**: Numbered, specific, actionable recommendations. This is the most important section - be clear and thorough

**TONE:**
- Professional and collegial
- Begin HPI with "Thank you for consulting me on..." or "Thank you for asking me to see..."
- Provide clear, actionable recommendations
- Offer to follow the patient and be available for questions

**KEY DIFFERENCE FROM H&P:**
- More focused, targeted to the specific consultation question
- Less comprehensive history and physical
- Emphasis on expert recommendations and management plan
- Always offer continued involvement and availability
